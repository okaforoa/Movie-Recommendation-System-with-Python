## Import Libraries
Necessary libraries are imported to handle data processing and analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We conduct an initial exploration of the dataset, focusing on the best-rated movies to gain insights into user preferences and movie ratings.

## Recommendation Method
The main implementation where we devise a method to recommend movies based on similarity metrics.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have the required libraries installed. Refer to the `Import Libraries` section.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with a larger dataset for more diverse recommendations.
- Implementing collaborative filtering for improved recommendations.
